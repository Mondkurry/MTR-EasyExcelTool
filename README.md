A Tool to make Line Lists, Valve Lists, and other Excel based spreadsheets quicker
## How it Works
1. User inputs a Spreadsheet using the tool and specifies the Sheet where the Valve List is located
2. User Selects the key Columns to check for duplicates
3. Save and Close excel file
4. Click the first "Generate Sheet" Button
5. This should generate an Input Sheet where the user can now input their data
6. Save and Close, then click the second "Generate Sheet" to generate an output.

### Note: 
If you want to see your sheet update with each change the second Generate sheet can be clicked as many times as needed. But be careful not to regenerate the Input Sheet as this will reset all data.

### Note 2: 
If you were to close the program then ensure that you have saved the data that you inputted in the Input Sheet previously before restarting.. as restarting the program may delete old the old input sheet.
